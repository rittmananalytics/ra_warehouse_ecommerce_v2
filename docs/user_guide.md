## 9. Data Quality Monitoring

**Purpose:** Monitor pipeline health and completeness.

### KPIs
- Source Test Pass Rate
- Integration Flow %
- Data Completeness %
- Pipeline Health Score

### Visualizations & Queries

#### üß™ Test Pass Rates by Pipeline Stage ‚Äì Stacked bar
```sql
SELECT 
  data_source,
  source_test_pass_rate,
  staging_test_pass_rate,
  integration_test_pass_rate,
  warehouse_test_pass_rate,
  overall_test_pass_rate
FROM `analytics_ecommerce_ecommerce.fact_data_quality`
ORDER BY overall_test_pass_rate DESC;
```

#### üßπ Data Completeness & Flow % ‚Äì Line chart
```sql
SELECT 
  data_source,
  source_rows,
  staging_rows,
  integration_rows,
  warehouse_rows,
  staging_flow_pct,
  integration_flow_pct,
  warehouse_flow_pct,
  data_completeness_pct
FROM `analytics_ecommerce_ecommerce.fact_data_quality`
ORDER BY source_rows DESC;
```

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Overall Quality Score Trend ‚Äì Gauge or line
```sql
SELECT 
  data_source,
  overall_pipeline_health_score,
  data_quality_rating,
  pipeline_efficiency_rating,
  CASE 
    WHEN overall_pipeline_health_score >= 95 THEN 'Excellent'
    WHEN overall_pipeline_health_score >= 85 THEN 'Good'
    WHEN overall_pipeline_health_score >= 70 THEN 'Needs Attention'
    ELSE 'Critical'
  END AS health_status
FROM `analytics_ecommerce_ecommerce.fact_data_quality`
ORDER BY overall_pipeline_health_score DESC;

## Best Practices

### Query Optimization
1. **Always use date filters** to limit data scanned
2. **Use appropriate aggregation levels** (daily/weekly/monthly)
3. **Leverage dimensional tables** for enrichment
4. **Apply WHERE clauses early** in CTEs

### Visualization Guidelines
1. **Color coding**: Use consistent colors across dashboards
2. **Date ranges**: Standardize on 30-day, 90-day periods
3. **Drill-down capability**: Enable users to explore details
4. **Mobile responsive**: Ensure charts work on all devices

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor query execution times
- Set up alerts for data freshness
- Track dashboard usage metrics
- Regular performance reviews

### Common Table References

#### Project and Dataset Structure
```sql
-- Primary warehouse dataset
analytics_ecommerce_ecommerce

-- Integration dataset  
analytics_ecommerce_integration

-- Staging dataset
analytics_ecommerce_staging
```

#### Key Join Patterns
```sql
-- Orders with Products
FROM fact_orders o
JOIN dim_products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id

-- Orders with Customers
FROM fact_orders o  
JOIN dim_customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id

-- Marketing with Channels
FROM fact_marketing_performance m
JOIN dim_channels ch ON m.source_name = ch.source_name

-- Events with Sessions
FROM fact_events e
JOIN fact_sessions s ON e.session_id = s.session_id
```
